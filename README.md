python_and_alg
==============

This repository contains a comprehensive study of Algorithms and Python, including an "ebook" that I wrote. In the folder /src/examples_in_my_book/, I made available all the examples and cases I used in my ebook. In the folder /futher_examples/ you can find all the solutions for the book Cracking the Code, and many examples from the websites Project Euler and Topcoder.
