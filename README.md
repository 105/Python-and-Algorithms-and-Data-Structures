Python and Algorithms & Data Structures
=======================================

This repository contains a comprehensive study of Algorithms and Python, including an ["e-book" that I wrote](http://mariwahl.us/docs/algorithms_in_python.pdf).



/src/examples_in_my_book/
-------------------------

All the examples and lessons I showed in my ebook.


/src/futher_examples/
---------------------

In the folder you find further examples in algorithms in Python, not mentioned in the the book:

* Solutions for the book Cracking the Code,
* Solution for Project Euler and Topcoder,...


/src/ipython/
-------------

Here I explain all the problems above in ipython notebooks.
