Another way:

Store two stacks, one of which contains all of the items in the stack and one of which is a stack of minima.

To push an element, push it onto the first stack. Check whether it is smaller than the top item on the second stack, if so, push it onto the second stack.

To pop an item, pop it from the first stack. If it is the top element, simply return the element on the top of the second stack.

O(1)...
