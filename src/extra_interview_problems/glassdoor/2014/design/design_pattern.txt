			 DESIGN PATTERNS
                    ------------------------

LISTENER/OBSERVER:
-----------------

- Example: a GUI as a listener to several objects. For any change in the state, it would update the display.


SINGLETON PATTERN:
-----------------

- To make sure that there is exactly one instance of something in the program.


MODEL-VIEW-CONTROLLER:
----------------------

- Design commonly used in user interfaces. The goal is to keep the data separate from the interface.
- Separate programming entities to store the data (model), display the data (view) and modify the data (controlle).
- The view usually makes heavy use of listeners to listen to changes and events in the model or controller.
